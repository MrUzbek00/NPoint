      <h4 class="h5 font-weight-bold mt-4">1. Data Ownership</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>All JSON data, documents, and APIs created by users remain the property of their respective creators.</li>
        <li>Users are fully responsible for the content they upload, share, or make public through Npoint Uz.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="h5 font-weight-bold mt-4">2. Public APIs</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>When a user marks a JSON document as public, it becomes accessible through an open API endpoint.</li>
        <li><strong>Npoint Uz does not take responsibility</strong> for how these public APIs are used in third-party applications, websites, or services.</li>
        <li>Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their public APIs do not contain sensitive, harmful, or illegal content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="h5 font-weight-bold mt-4">3. Private APIs</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can choose to keep their APIs private. In such cases, access is restricted and requires authentication via unique tokens.</li>
        <li>Responsibility for securing tokens rests with the user. Npoint Uz is not liable for any unauthorized access due to lost or compromised tokens.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="h5 font-weight-bold mt-4">4. Security</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>We take reasonable steps to secure our platform and infrastructure.</li>
        <li>However, no system is 100% secure. Users should avoid uploading sensitive personal or financial data into public APIs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="h5 font-weight-bold mt-4">5. Limitation of Liability</h4>
      <p>By using Npoint Uz, you agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Npoint Uz is not liable for damages, misuse, or issues arising from the use of public APIs.</li>
        <li>Any risks associated with integrating public APIs into third-party projects rest solely with the user.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="h5 font-weight-bold mt-4">6. Changes to This Policy</h4>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.</p>
